        <h2>summary</h2>
        <div>
           <p> At the beginning of Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts students are told they will hold the once famous Triwizard Tournament, hosting witches from Beauxbatons Academy and wizards from the Durmstrang Magical Institute.

            The Goblet of Fire selects a student to compete from each school. This year, however, two contestants are selected from Hogwarts: Cedric Diggory and Harry. Along with the other competitors (Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour), they must race to complete three tasks. Task one: snatch a golden egg from a nest guarded by a deadly dragon. Task two: retrieve something valuable from the bottom of the Hogwart's lake. Task three: make way through a trap-laden labyrinth and retrieve the Triwizard Cup.
            
            During the second task, Harry falls behind after valiantly saving Fleur Delacour's sister. After trading hints about the first and second tasks, Harry and Cedric work together to complete the third and final task. When they reach the Cup, they grab it at the same time. The cup, it turns out, is a portkey, and Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard, where they're welcomed by Voldemort and a slew of Death Eaters.
            
            Voldemort has Cedric killed immediately and reveals that Harry's advancement in the tournament was pre-planned. Wormtail (formerly Scabbers) obtains some of Harry's blood and uses it in a revival ritual to restore Voldemort's human form and wizarding powers. Harry duels with Voldemort before grabbing the Cup and transporting to Hogwarts. The fanfare of the tournament ends when Harry returns with Cedric's body.
